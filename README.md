## 🙌 Why I Built This

I was tired of being blocked from accessing my own university’s shared study materials just because I wasn’t on a premium plan. So I created this to help every student — regardless of budget — get the resources they need.

> 🧠 Knowledge should be free. This is just a small step in making that true.
